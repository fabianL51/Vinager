# Vinager

Vinager is a simple financial manager that handles daily transactions data to give users a good overview over incomes and expenses. Users only need to enter the transaction details and the program deals with the bookkeeping and recurring incomes and expenses. This program based on a financial manager named Diskcounter (https://github.com/fabianL51/Diskcounter) that I developed using VBA. The use of C++ in Vinager is meant to increase the processing speed of the transactions data compared to Diskcounter. Moreover, users can use Vinager without needing to have Microsoft Excel (as Diskcounter only works in Microsoft Excel).

This is currently still under development. At this stage, processes can only be run through the terminals in Linux. The goal is to integrate a user interface (probably through Qt) to run the program. 

For examples, you can check exe folder and open the .csv files generated by the scripts. Documentation about the generated .csv files will be provided after the program is launched.

## Special Features

1. Vinager can handle more than 3 Accounts compared to Diskcounter
2. Vinager stores its process' outputs in .csv files, which can be opened with every text editor. Therefore, you can open these using free open source softwares.
